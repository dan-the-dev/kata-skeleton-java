# KATA SKELETON DAN THE DEV - JAVA VERSION

## How to use the template

Create your own repository starting from the template here on GitHub - give a name meaningful for the Kata exercise.
Currently, Java kata template is not Dockerized - opening the cloned repoistory folder with IntelliJ should be enough - 
then simply use IntelliJ to run the tests via interface (Play button in the test class)

NB: if you can help in Dockerizing the template, feel free to help please! :)
